You can look at the [sample content](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2765001).

Throughout the book "Try and Experiment" sections provide exercises to
apply the concepts and gain hands-on experience. The example project
provide the foundation for these and show how the technologies can
actually be used.

### Part I: Foundations

In this part Chapter 1 provides the basics to understand Continuous
Delivery. Chapter 2 explains the technical foundations of Continuous Delivery: It
discusses the automated deployment of infrastructure and the
automated installation of software without which Continuous Delivery
would be impossible.

### Part III: Management, Organization, and Architecture for Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery is not just a technology but reaches much
further. This is the focus of the last chapters of the book:

- Chapter 9 explains how Continuous Delivery can be introduced into an enterprise.
- Chapter 10 shows the connection between the technical Continuous
  Delivery approach and DevOps - an organizational approach.
- Continuous Delivery and DevOps also influence software
  architecture. Chapter 11 details this.
- Chapter 12 finally provides a conclusion of the book.
